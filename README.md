This project delivers an interactive Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard for a B2B computer hardware company, built to solve the leadership challenge of fragmented sales reporting. The organization lacked a unified view of 2017 performance across regions, products, customer segments, and sales teams, making it difficult to track revenue drops, compare YTD vs previous year, or identify underperforming areas. To address this, I consolidated multiple datasets into a structured star schema model, cleaned and transformed data using Power Query, and engineered calculated fields such as company size, client segments, purchase frequency, lifecycle metrics, and DAX-based KPIs including Conversion Rate, Average Purchase Value, CLV, and Revenue Growth. 🧩📈

The dashboard visualizes company-level performance (total revenue $9.48M and 3,988 units sold), quarterly trends showing a strong Q2 followed by a 44.48% drop in Q4, and a detailed product mix where GTX Plus Pro drove the highest revenue while GTX Basic led in unit sales. Regional insights show that the North Zone generated the highest revenue ($3.36M), Headquarters achieved the highest monthly order volume, and the South Zone recorded the strongest average purchase value ($2.67K). 🌍💼 Sales team analysis highlights major performance gaps—Melvin’s team achieved $2.1M (the highest), Dustin’s reached $1M, while Rocco’s team outperformed Cara’s in the South. Agent-level patterns revealed that top results correlated more with order volume and purchase value rather than just conversion rates or cycle times.

Customer analytics uncovered 85 active clients, with 64 in the Silver segment, dominated by large enterprises (80.2%), mainly in the Americas (95% from the US). Retail and Technology sectors led acquisitions, while retention stayed stable until a sharp decline in the final month, indicating potential year-end churn risk. The dashboard also tracks client lifetime, average lifespan (380 days), and average CLV ($116K), helping identify high-value accounts for strategic engagement. 🧠🤝

Overall, this Power BI solution transformed decision-making from reactive → proactive, enabling leadership to monitor KPIs in real time, evaluate regional performance, diagnose Q4 revenue declines, improve sales team productivity, and strengthen retention strategies. By unifying all sales data into a single analytical environment, the dashboard provides clarity on growth opportunities, supports smarter resource allocation, and drives stronger long-term customer loyalty. 🚀📊
