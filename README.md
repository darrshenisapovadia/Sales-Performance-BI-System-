Sales Performance Dashboard – Power BI

This project delivers an interactive Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard for a B2B computer hardware company, built to solve the leadership challenge of fragmented sales reporting. The organization lacked a unified view of 2017 performance across regions, products, customer segments, and sales teams, making it difficult to track revenue drops, compare YTD vs previous year, or identify underperforming areas. To address this, I consolidated multiple datasets into a structured star schema model, cleaned and transformed data using Power Query, and engineered calculated fields such as company size, client segments, purchase frequency, lifecycle metrics, and DAX-based KPIs including Conversion Rate, Average Purchase Value, CLV, and Revenue Growth.

The dashboard visualizes company-level performance (total revenue $9.48M and 3,988 units sold), quarterly trends showing a strong Q2 followed by a 44.48% drop in Q4, and a detailed product mix where GTX Plus Pro drove the highest revenue while GTX Basic led in unit sales. Regional insights highlight that the North Zone generated the highest revenue ($3.36M), Headquarters achieved the highest monthly order volume, and the South Zone recorded the strongest average purchase value ($2.67K). Sales team analysis shows significant performance disparities—Melvin’s team achieved $2.1M (the highest), Dustin’s reached $1M, while Rocco’s team outperformed Cara’s in the South. Agent-level analysis revealed that strong results correlated more with higher order volumes and purchase values rather than just conversion rates or cycle times.

Customer analytics identified 85 active clients, with 64 in the Silver segment, dominated by large enterprises (80.2%) primarily located in the Americas (95% from the US). Retail and Technology sectors led client acquisition, while retention remained stable until a sharp decline in the final month, signaling end-of-year churn risk. The dashboard also tracks client lifetime, average lifespan (380 days), average CLV ($116K), and identifies high-value customers for targeted engagement.

Overall, this Power BI solution transformed the company’s decision-making from reactive to proactive. Leadership can now view real-time KPIs, compare regional performance, diagnose Q4 revenue loss drivers, optimize sales team efficiency, and strengthen customer retention strategies. The consolidated analytics environment provides clarity on growth opportunities, supports better resource allocation, and enhances strategic planning for both sales performance and client lifecycle management.
